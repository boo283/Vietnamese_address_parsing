# Vietnamese_address_parsing
Vietnamese address parsing is my personal project which concentrate on parsing location real estate data from Internet. The input is presented as a string containing user-generated address, which is then parsed into hierachial token as city/province, district, ward. It could determine the province if it is not provided in the input.
